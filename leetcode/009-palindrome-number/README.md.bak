# Palindrome Number

## 📝 Problem Statement

This exercise focuses on determining whether an integer is a **palindrome**. An integer is a palindrome if it reads the same forward and backward.

- Negative numbers are **not palindromes**.
- You are tasked with returning a boolean indicating whether the number is a palindrome.

**Follow-up:** Solve the problem **without converting the integer to a string**.

---

---

## 📥 Input

- A single integer `x`.

**Note:**  
Do not read input from `stdin` or console. The function will receive the integer `x` as input.

## 📤 Output

_Output format not specified in original README._

---

## 🔍 Examples

_No examples provided in original README._

---

## 💡 Approach

_Approach not described in original README._

**Time Complexity:** ** \(O(\log\_{10} x)\), as we only process half of the digits

**Space Complexity:** ** \(O(1)\), no extra space is required

# Palindrome Number

## Problem Description

This exercise focuses on determining whether an integer is a **palindrome**. An integer is a palindrome if it reads the same forward and backward.

- Negative numbers are **not palindromes**.
- You are tasked with returning a boolean indicating whether the number is a palindrome.

**Follow-up:** Solve the problem **without converting the integer to a string**.

## Function Description

Complete the `isPalindrome` function with the following parameter:

- **x**: an integer

**Return Requirement:**  
Return `true` if `x` is a palindrome, otherwise return `false`.

---

## Input Format

- A single integer `x`.

**Note:**  
Do not read input from `stdin` or console. The function will receive the integer `x` as input.

---

## Constraints

- \(-2^{31} \leq x \leq 2^{31} - 1\)

---

## Sample Input 1

121

## Sample Output 1

true

### Explanation

121 reads the same forward and backward.

---

## Sample Input 2

-121

## Sample Output 2

false

### Explanation

Reading from right to left gives 121-, which is not the same as -121.

---

## Sample Input 3

10

## Sample Output 3

false

### Explanation

Reading from right to left gives 01, which is not equal to 10.
