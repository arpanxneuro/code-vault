## 📝 Problem Statement

Given a square matrix `M` of size `N x N`, your task is to compute and return the sum of the **principal diagonal** elements of the matrix.  
The **principal diagonal** of a matrix consists of elements where the row index and column index are the same.

You have to complete the function **`diagonalSum()`** which accepts:
- `N` (size of the matrix, `N x N`)
- `M` (the matrix itself as a 2D list)
