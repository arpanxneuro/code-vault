# Sum of Diagonals

## 📝 Problem Statement

Given a square matrix `M` of size `N x N`, your task is to compute and return the sum of the **principal diagonal** elements of the matrix.  
The **principal diagonal** of a matrix consists of elements where the row index and column index are the same.

You have to complete the function **`diagonalSum()`** which accepts:
- `N` (size of the matrix, `N x N`)
- `M` (the matrix itself as a 2D list)

# Sum of Diagonals

## Problem Statement
Given a square matrix `M` of size `N x N`, your task is to compute and return the sum of the **principal diagonal** elements of the matrix.  
The **principal diagonal** of a matrix consists of elements where the row index and column index are the same.

You have to complete the function **`diagonalSum()`** which accepts:
- `N` (size of the matrix, `N x N`)
- `M` (the matrix itself as a 2D list)

---

## Input Format
- The first line contains an integer `T` — the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - The first line contains the integer `N` — the size of the matrix.
  - The second line contains `N * N` integers, representing the elements of the matrix in **row-major order**.

---

## Output Format
- For each test case, print the sum of the principal diagonal elements in a new line.

---

## Constraints
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 50
1 <= M[i][j] <= 100

## Example

### Input
1
3
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9


### Output
15

### Explanation
For the given 3x3 matrix:
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

python
Copy
Edit
The principal diagonal elements are: `1, 5, 9`  
Sum = `1 + 5 + 9 = 15`
