# 🔁 Rotate Array by One (Clockwise)

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Given an array `arr[]`, your task is to rotate it **by one position in the clockwise direction**. That is, the last element of the array becomes the first, and all other elements are shifted one index forward.

---

## 📥 Input

- An integer array `arr[]` of size `n`.

### 🔒 Constraints

- `1 <= arr.length <= 10⁵`
- `0 <= arr[i] <= 10⁵`

---

## 📤 Output

- Return or print the updated array after rotating by one position in the clockwise direction.

---

## ✅ Examples

### Example 1:
```text
Input:  arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```
### Example 2:
```text
Input:  arr = [9, 8, 7, 6, 4, 2, 1, 3]
Output: [3, 9, 8, 7, 6, 4, 2, 1]
```
