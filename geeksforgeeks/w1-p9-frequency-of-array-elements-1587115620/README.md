# 📊 Problem Title: Frequencies in a Limited Array

## 🧩 Problem Statement

You are given an array `arr[]` of positive integers where the elements range from `1` to `n` (where `n` is the size of the array). Some numbers may be repeated, and others may be missing. Your task is to compute the frequency of each number from `1` to `n` and return an array of size `n` such that `result[i]` represents the frequency of number `i + 1` (1-based indexing).

---

## 📥 Input Format

- An integer array `arr[]` of size `n`
- All elements are in the range `1` to `n`

### 🔒 Constraints

- `1 ≤ arr.length ≤ 10⁶`
- `1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ arr.length`

---

## 📤 Output Format

- An array of size `n` where `result[i]` is the frequency of number `i + 1`
