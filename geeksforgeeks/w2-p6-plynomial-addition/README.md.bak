# Polynomial Addition

## 📝 Problem Statement

This exercise focuses on adding two polynomials represented as arrays. You are given two arrays where each element represents a coefficient of a polynomial term in increasing order of powers. The task is to compute the sum of the two polynomials and return it as a new array.

## 📥 Input

- First line: integer `n`, the degree of the first polynomial + 1  
- Next line: `n` space-separated integers, coefficients of the first polynomial  
- Next line: integer `m`, the degree of the second polynomial + 1  
- Next line: `m` space-separated integers, coefficients of the second polynomial

**Note:**  
Do not read input from `stdin` or console. The function will receive the arrays as input.

# Polynomial Addition

## Problem Description
This exercise focuses on adding two polynomials represented as arrays. You are given two arrays where each element represents a coefficient of a polynomial term in increasing order of powers. The task is to compute the sum of the two polynomials and return it as a new array.  

---

## Function Description
Complete the `addPolynomials` function with the following parameters:

- **poly1**: an array of integers representing the first polynomial coefficients  
- **poly2**: an array of integers representing the second polynomial coefficients

**Return Requirement:**  
Return an array of integers representing the coefficients of the sum polynomial in increasing order of powers.

## Input Format
- First line: integer `n`, the degree of the first polynomial + 1  
- Next line: `n` space-separated integers, coefficients of the first polynomial  
- Next line: integer `m`, the degree of the second polynomial + 1  
- Next line: `m` space-separated integers, coefficients of the second polynomial

**Note:**  
Do not read input from `stdin` or console. The function will receive the arrays as input.

---

## Constraints
- \(1 \leq n, m \leq 1000\)  
- Coefficients can be any integer within the signed 32-bit range

## Sample Input
3
1 2 3
2
4 5

## Sample Output
5 7 3

### Explanation
- First polynomial: \(1 + 2x + 3x^2\)  
- Second polynomial: \(4 + 5x\)  
- Sum: \((1 + 2x + 3x^2) + (4 + 5x) = 5 + 7x + 3x^2\)  
- Coefficients in increasing powers: `[5, 7, 3]`

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(\max(n, m))\)  
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(\max(n, m))\), to store the sum coefficients
