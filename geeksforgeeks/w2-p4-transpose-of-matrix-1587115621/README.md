# Transpose of Matrix

## 📝 Problem Statement

You are given a square matrix of size `n x n`. Your task is to find the **transpose** of the matrix.  

The **transpose** of a matrix is obtained by converting all **rows into columns** and all **columns into rows**.

---

---

## 📥 Input

- An integer `n` representing the size of the square matrix.  
- `n*n` integers representing the elements of the matrix in row-wise order.

---

---

## 📤 Output

- The transposed matrix of size `n x n`.

---

---

## 🔍 Examples

**Input**
mat = [
    [1, 2],
    [9, -2]
]
**Output**
[
    [1, 9],
    [2, -2]
]

# Transpose of Matrix

## Problem Statement
You are given a square matrix of size `n x n`. Your task is to find the **transpose** of the matrix.  

The **transpose** of a matrix is obtained by converting all **rows into columns** and all **columns into rows**.

---

## Input
- An integer `n` representing the size of the square matrix.  
- `n*n` integers representing the elements of the matrix in row-wise order.

---

## Output
- The transposed matrix of size `n x n`.

---

## Constraints
- `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3`  
- `-10^9 ≤ mat[i][j] ≤ 10^9`

---

## Example

**Input**
mat = [
    [1, 2],
    [9, -2]
]
**Output**
[
    [1, 9],
    [2, -2]
]

## Explanation
Rows are converted to columns:

- First row `[1, 2]` → First column `[1, 9]`
- Second row `[9, -2]` → Second column `[2, -2]`

---

## Guidelines
- Focus on **in-place transposition** if possible to save space.  
- Ensure **time complexity** is O(n²).  
- Handle **edge cases** like `n = 1`.
