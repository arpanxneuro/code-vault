## 🧩 Problem Statement

You are given an array `arr[]` of non-negative integers. Your task is to **move all the zeroes to the end of the array**, while maintaining the **relative order of the non-zero elements**.

This must be done **in-place**, meaning **no additional space** (like another array) should be used.

---

## 🧪 Examples

### Example 1:
➡️ Three zeroes have been moved to the end, preserving the order of non-zero elements.

### Example 2:
➡️ No change required; no zeroes present.

### Example 3:
➡️ All elements are zeroes; array remains unchanged.

## 📌 Constraints

- `1 ≤ arr.length ≤ 10^5`
- `0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^5`

---

## ✅ Expected Time Complexity

- **Time:** `O(n)`
- **Space:** `O(1)` (in-place)
