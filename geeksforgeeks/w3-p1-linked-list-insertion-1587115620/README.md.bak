# Linked List Insertion

## 📝 Problem Statement

This exercise focuses on inserting a new node into a singly linked list. You are given a pointer to the head node of the linked list and an integer `data`. The task is to insert a new node containing `data` at the **end of the linked list**.  

- If the linked list is empty (`head` is `NULL`), the new node becomes the head.

---

---

## 📥 Input

- First line: integer `n`, number of nodes already in the linked list  
- Next `n` lines: node values  
- Last line: integer `data` to insert at the tail

**Note:**  
Do not read input from `stdin` or console. The function will receive the head reference and the integer `data`.

## 🔍 Examples

3
10
20
30
40

## 💡 Approach

_Approach not described in original README._

**Time Complexity:** ** \(O(n)\), since we may need to traverse the list to reach the tail

**Space Complexity:** ** \(O(1)\), as insertion is done in-place

# Linked List Insertion

## Problem Description
This exercise focuses on inserting a new node into a singly linked list. You are given a pointer to the head node of the linked list and an integer `data`. The task is to insert a new node containing `data` at the **end of the linked list**.  

- If the linked list is empty (`head` is `NULL`), the new node becomes the head.

---

## Function Description
Complete the `insertNodeAtTail` function with the following parameters:

- **head**: a reference to the head of the linked list  
- **data**: the value to insert

**Return Requirement:**  
Return the head of the modified linked list.

---

## Input Format
- First line: integer `n`, number of nodes already in the linked list  
- Next `n` lines: node values  
- Last line: integer `data` to insert at the tail

**Note:**  
Do not read input from `stdin` or console. The function will receive the head reference and the integer `data`.

---

## Constraints
- \(0 \leq n \leq 10^5\)  
- Node values and `data` are 32-bit integers.

---

## Sample Input
3
10
20
30
40

## Sample Output
10 -> 20 -> 30 -> 40 -> NULL

### Explanation
- Original list: 10 -> 20 -> 30  
- Insert 40 at the tail → 10 -> 20 -> 30 -> 40

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\), since we may need to traverse the list to reach the tail  
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\), as insertion is done in-place
