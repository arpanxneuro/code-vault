# Print the Elements of a Linked List

## 📝 Problem Statement

This exercise focuses on traversing a linked list. You are given a pointer to the head node of a linked list. The task is to print the data of each node, one per line. If the head pointer is `NULL`, indicating the list is empty, nothing should be printed.

---

## 📥 Input

- The first line of input contains an integer `n`, the number of elements in the linked list.  
- The next `n` lines contain one element each, representing the data values for the nodes.

**Note:**  
Do not read input from `stdin` or console. The function will receive the list head reference.

## 🔍 Examples

2

## 💡 Approach

_Approach not described in original README._

**Time Complexity:** ** \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the linked list.

**Space Complexity:** ** \(O(1)\), since we only use a pointer to traverse the list.

# Print the Elements of a Linked List

## Problem Description
This exercise focuses on traversing a linked list. You are given a pointer to the head node of a linked list. The task is to print the data of each node, one per line. If the head pointer is `NULL`, indicating the list is empty, nothing should be printed.

### Function Description
Complete the `printLinkedList` function with the following parameter:

- **head**: a reference to the head of the list

**Print Requirement:**  
For each node, print its data value on a new line (`console.log` in JavaScript, `printf` in C, `print()` in Python, etc.).

---

## Input Format
- The first line of input contains an integer `n`, the number of elements in the linked list.  
- The next `n` lines contain one element each, representing the data values for the nodes.

**Note:**  
Do not read input from `stdin` or console. The function will receive the list head reference.

---

## Constraints
- \( 1 \leq n \leq 1000 \)  
- Node values can be any integer within the signed 32-bit range.

---

## Sample Input
2
16
13

## Sample Output
16
13

### Explanation
There are two elements in the linked list. They are represented as:
16 -> 13 -> NULL
So the function should print `16` and `13` each on a new line.

---

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the linked list.  
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\), since we only use a pointer to traverse the list.
