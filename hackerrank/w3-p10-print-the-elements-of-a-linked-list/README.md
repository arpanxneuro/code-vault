## 📝 Problem Statement

This exercise focuses on traversing a linked list. You are given a pointer to the head node of a linked list. The task is to print the data of each node, one per line. If the head pointer is `NULL`, indicating the list is empty, nothing should be printed.

## 📥 Input

- The first line of input contains an integer `n`, the number of elements in the linked list.  
- The next `n` lines contain one element each, representing the data values for the nodes.

**Note:**  
Do not read input from `stdin` or console. The function will receive the list head reference.
